## ü§ñ What is an SS7 SMS Interception Bot?

This project simulates a bot that exploits SS7 signaling flaws to **intercept one-time passwords (OTP)** and **SMS-based 2FA messages** by manipulating the global mobile switching infrastructure.

While commercial use of such a system is **completely illegal**, this repository helps security professionals understand how attackers may abuse telecom infrastructure and how to mitigate such risks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the SMS Interception Bot Works

1. **Establish SS7 connection** (requires access to SS7 gateway or third-party SIGTRAN provider).
2. **Send MAP-SEND-ROUTING-INFO-FOR-SM** request to retrieve victim's MSC.
3. **Send MAP-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE** to hijack SMS delivery.
4. Extract OTP or verification code from intercepted message body.
